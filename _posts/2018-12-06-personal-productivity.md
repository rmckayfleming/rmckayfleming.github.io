excerpt: "Personal productivity is a vast topic. There’s a multitude of systems for managing tasks, plans, and what not. This year has been interesting for me in that regard since I’ve spent a fair bit of time thinking about planning. People have so much to do, they look for ways to optimize getting it all done. The truth is there’s no perfect system, and even if you adopt one, you likely won’t keep up with it. More likely than not you’re also doing it for the wrong reasons."

Personal productivity is a vast topic. There’s a multitude of systems for managing tasks, plans, and what not. This year has been interesting for me in that regard since I’ve spent a fair bit of time thinking about planning. People have so much to do, they look for ways to optimize getting it all done. The truth is there’s no perfect system, and even if you adopt one, you likely won’t keep up with it. More likely than not you’re also doing it for the wrong reasons.

## The Now ##
When you’re overwhelmed with things to do, you need help getting through it all. This is what I consider _the now_. To help with _the now_, there are so many different methodologies and systems. You may have heard of GTD (Getting Things Done), Pomodoro, or Kanban. The best ones are often the simplest ones. Any of them can help you manage your tasks and get more done.

I particularly like the concepts of GTD. I don’t use it exactly, but I follow a similar idea. I have two primary “inboxes” to track tasks (my email and an Apple Notes note). Every day, I go through my inboxes and do the things that are quick to do. Once I’ve gone through the quick things I start working through my longer tasks. I order them as follows: Important and Urgent, Important and Not Urgent, Urgent and Not Important, and Not Urgent and Not Important.

I started doing this earlier in the year to great success. Now it’s a habit.

But, there’s a danger with just following a task management system. It’s looking back at the week and not remembering what you actually did. This happened to me.

It’s one thing to mark things off of your checklist. It’s another to feel good about it. Which brings me to the later.

## The Later ##
_The later_ is the things that are meaningful. _The later_ is your long-term plan and goals. Most people have them, the problem is actually getting started on them. It’s easy to fall into just working on things as they come up to the detriment of your own personal goals.

Lately, I've been planning my weeks and days ahead of time. Every Monday my first task is to lay out what a successful week looks like to me. I fill it in with the “right” tasks I want to complete. I choose what’s important and urgent to me. That way, when Friday evening rolls around, I can look back and plainly see if I had a successful week or not.

It feels far better to see a completed list than a half completed one. But, I also know my week is going to fill up with random things to do. Which is why I break the list into two: “What I can accomplish” and “What would be nice to accomplish.” The first list I know with 90-100% certainty that I can do in the week. If I do anything on the second list, it’s a cherry on top. Sometimes, the random things that come up are meaningful! For that reason, I also keep a list of the “Other meaningful things I did” to record the things that came up that were worthwhile.

Planning my week in advance has helped me feel far more accomplished. Personal productivity isn’t about getting work done. It’s about feeling accomplished. Accomplishment isn’t about marking things off of a checklist, it’s about making progress towards your goals. Design your life around that.
